# Neurodivergent Survival Guide - Project Handoff Document

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Complete Project Architecture Defined
- **Total Scope**: 99 pages (5 conditions + 74 struggles + 20 glossary clusters)
- **Complete Taxonomy**: Every page named, slugified, described, and cross-referenced
- **URL Structure**: Standardized `/conditions/`, `/struggles/`, `/glossary/` paths
- **Content Framework**: 6-section structure for all struggle pages established

### 2. Jekyll Data Files Created
- **conditions.yml**: 5 condition pages with slugs and descriptions
- **struggles.yml**: 74 struggle pages with condition associations  
- **glossary.yml**: 20 concept clusters with descriptions
- **Navigation Ready**: Data structure supports automatic prev/next banners

### 3. Template Pages Completed
- **Executive Function Glossary**: Golden template for all 20 glossary cluster pages
  - 8 interconnected terms with lived experience examples
  - Cross-linking to struggles and conditions
  - "Search by feeling" discovery method
  - Community notes with authentic voice
- **ADHD Condition Page**: Template for remaining condition pages
  - Links to all 16 ADHD-specific struggles + 8 cross-cutting
  - Co-occurring conditions section
  - Related resources (curated glossary clusters)
- **Autism Condition Page**: Upgraded with same structure as ADHD

### 4. Content Standards Locked In
- **Tone Guidelines**: Clinically neutral, authentic but not presumptuous
- **Safety System**: Centralized JavaScript disclaimer (NO manual disclaimers)
- **Accessibility**: 5th grade reading level, progressive disclosure
- **Cross-Linking**: Bidirectional connections throughout site

### 5. Established Concept Clusters for Glossary
Each cluster covers 5-8 related terms:
- **Social Communication** (autism-focused)
- **Sensory Processing** (autism/cross-cutting)
- **Executive Function** (ADHD-focused, template completed)
- **Attention and Focus** (ADHD-focused)
- **Emotional Regulation** (covers meltdowns/shutdowns)
- **Rejection and Criticism** (RSD-focused)
- **Identity and Self-Concept** (cross-cutting)
- **Relationship Dynamics** (BPD-focused)
- **Mood Episodes** (bipolar-focused)
- **Intrusive Thoughts and Compulsions** (OCD-focused)
- Plus 10 more clusters covering all neurodivergent experiences

## Current Status: Pages Completed

### âœ… COMPLETED (3 pages)
1. **Executive Function Glossary Cluster** - Template for all 20 glossary pages
2. **ADHD Condition Page** - Template for remaining condition pages  
3. **Autism Condition Page** - Upgraded with full structure

### ðŸ”² REMAINING (96 pages)

#### Condition Pages (3 remaining)
4. **Bipolar** - Use ADHD template, focus on mood episodes
5. **Borderline Personality Disorder** - Relationship dynamics emphasis
6. **OCD** - Intrusive thoughts and compulsions focus

#### Struggle Pages (74 total)
All using 6-section framework:
- What this feels like
- Why this might be happening  
- Next 5 minutes (immediate help)
- Long-term solutions
- When to seek medical intervention
- You're not imagining this

#### Glossary Cluster Pages (19 remaining)
Use Executive Function template structure, adapt content to each cluster's terms.

## Next Priorities (In Order)

### Phase 1: Complete Foundation (3 condition pages)
**Immediate next step: Bipolar condition page**
- Use ADHD template structure
- 18 bipolar-specific struggles + 8 cross-cutting
- Related resources: Mood Episodes, Emotional Regulation, Medication and Treatment
- Navigation: Previous: Autism, Next: Borderline Personality Disorder

### Phase 2: High-Impact Struggle Pages (20-30 most common)
Focus on struggles that appear across multiple conditions:
- Task Initiation Paralysis (ADHD)
- Missing Social Cues (Autism)
- Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (ADHD)
- Masking Burnout (Autism)
- Executive Function Challenges (Cross-cutting)
- Sensory Processing Challenges (Autism)
- Emotional Dysregulation (ADHD)
- Plus cross-cutting struggles

### Phase 3: Complete Glossary Clusters (19 remaining)
Use Executive Function as exact template:
- Social Communication (autism struggles)
- Sensory Processing (autism struggles)  
- Attention and Focus (ADHD struggles)
- Emotional Regulation (includes meltdowns/shutdowns)
- Mood Episodes (bipolar struggles)
- Intrusive Thoughts and Compulsions (OCD struggles)
- Etc.

### Phase 4: Remaining Struggle Pages (fill out taxonomy)

## Key Implementation Notes

### Disclaimer System
- **NEVER** include manual disclaimer sections in pages
- JavaScript handles all safety messaging automatically
- Pages should have proper DOM insertion points (header, breadcrumb, container)

### Cross-Linking Standards
- All struggle pages link to parent condition(s)
- All conditions link to their specific + cross-cutting struggles
- Glossary clusters link to related struggles and conditions
- Use exact taxonomy URLs established in Jekyll data files

### Template Consistency
- **Condition pages**: Use ADHD structure exactly
- **Struggle pages**: 6-section framework (see content guidelines)
- **Glossary clusters**: Use Executive Function structure exactly
- Maintain color schemes: ADHD (pink), Autism (blue), Bipolar (purple), BPD (orange), OCD (green)

## Critical Files to Reference

### Content Guidelines
The complete content standards document with tone, safety, structure requirements.

### Project Specification  
The master list of all 99 pages with descriptions - this is the definitive reference for what each page should cover.

### Jekyll Data Files
Three .yml files that power the entire navigation system and define the site structure.

### Template Pages
Executive Function glossary cluster and ADHD condition page serve as exact templates for creating remaining pages.

## Workflow for Continuing

1. **Identify next page to create** (start with Bipolar condition page)
2. **Reference appropriate template** (ADHD for conditions, Executive Function for glossary)
3. **Check taxonomy specification** for exact content scope and description
4. **Maintain cross-linking** using established URL structure
5. **Follow content guidelines** for tone, reading level, safety
6. **No manual disclaimers** - rely on JavaScript system

The foundation is complete. The remaining work is systematically creating pages using established templates and standards while maintaining the interconnected ecosystem we've designed.
