        <h2 id="what-this-feels-like">What This Feels Like</h2>
        <p><a class="jargon">Stimming<span class="tooltip">Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, rocking, or fidgeting that help regulate emotions and sensory input</span></a> and <a class="jargon">sensory seeking<span class="tooltip">Actively pursuing specific sensory experiences to help your nervous system feel balanced</span></a> often feel like essential self-regulation that your body craves, but which draws unwanted attention or judgment from others. Your hands might need to move, your body might need to rock or bounce, or you might need specific textures, sounds, or pressures to feel calm and focused.</p>

        <p>The conflict between your <a class="jargon">sensory needs<span class="tooltip">Your nervous system's requirements for specific types of sensory input to function optimally</span></a> and social expectations can feel exhausting. You might find yourself suppressing natural movements or <a class="jargon">self-soothing behaviors<span class="tooltip">Actions that help calm and regulate your emotional and sensory state</span></a> in public, leading to internal tension and discomfort. When you can't <a class="jargon">stim<span class="tooltip">Engage in repetitive self-regulating movements or behaviors</span></a> freely, you might feel like a pressure cooker building steam with no release valve.</p>

        <p>People might comment on your movements - asking why you're bouncing your leg, telling you to sit still, or staring when you engage in <a class="jargon">hand flapping<span class="tooltip">Repetitive hand movements often used for emotional regulation or excitement</span></a> or other visible <a class="jargon">repetitive behaviors<span class="tooltip">Actions you repeat that help you self-regulate, focus, or manage emotions</span></a>. These reactions can make you feel self-conscious about behaviors that are genuinely helping you function, creating a catch-22 where you need to stim to regulate but feel judged for doing so.</p>

        <p>Your <a class="jargon">sensory regulation<span class="tooltip">How your nervous system processes and responds to sensory information to maintain optimal functioning</span></a> needs might include seeking specific types of input - deep pressure through tight clothing or weighted blankets, <a class="jargon">proprioceptive input<span class="tooltip">Sensory information from your muscles and joints about body position and movement</span></a> through stretching or heavy work, or <a class="jargon">vestibular stimulation<span class="tooltip">Sensory input related to balance and movement that affects your inner ear</span></a> through spinning or swinging. When these needs go unmet, you might feel disorganized, anxious, or unable to concentrate.</p>

        <p>You might have developed <a class="jargon">covert stims<span class="tooltip">Subtle or hidden self-regulating behaviors that are less noticeable to others</span></a> - ways of meeting your sensory needs that are less visible to others, such as clicking a pen, fidgeting with jewelry, or tensing and releasing muscles. While these help you function in social situations, they might not provide the same level of regulation as your natural, unrestricted movements.</p>

        <p>The emotional component can be just as important as the sensory one. <a class="jargon">Stimming<span class="tooltip">Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, rocking, or fidgeting that help regulate emotions and sensory input</span></a> might help you process excitement, manage anxiety, work through frustration, or celebrate joy. When others misinterpret these expressions as "inappropriate" or "disruptive," it can feel like your natural emotional processing is being policed.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Common experiences:</strong> Needing to move or fidget to concentrate; feeling judged for repetitive movements; suppressing stims in public and feeling uncomfortable; seeking specific textures, pressures, or movements; using objects like fidget toys or jewelry for regulation; feeling more organized and calm when able to stim freely.</p>

    <div class="why-section">
        <h2 id="why-this-happens">Why This Might Be Happening</h2>
        <p>Autistic nervous systems often have different <a class="jargon">sensory processing patterns<span class="tooltip">How your brain receives, interprets, and responds to sensory information from your environment</span></a> that make <a class="jargon">self-regulation<span class="tooltip">Your ability to manage your emotions, attention, and behavior</span></a> through movement and sensory input both necessary and effective. Your brain might need more or different types of sensory information to maintain optimal <a class="jargon">arousal levels<span class="tooltip">Your nervous system's state of alertness and activation</span></a> for attention, emotional balance, and cognitive function.</p>

        <p><a class="jargon">Stimming<span class="tooltip">Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, rocking, or fidgeting that help regulate emotions and sensory input</span></a> serves multiple neurological functions. It can help modulate <a class="jargon">sensory input<span class="tooltip">Information your nervous system receives through sight, sound, touch, movement, and other senses</span></a> when you're feeling overwhelmed, provide needed stimulation when you're under-aroused, help process intense emotions, and improve focus by giving your brain predictable sensory patterns to organize around.</p>

        <p>Your <a class="jargon">proprioceptive system<span class="tooltip">Your body's sense of where it is in space and how your muscles and joints are positioned</span></a> - which tells you where your body is in space - might need more input than typical to function optimally. This can create cravings for <a class="jargon">deep pressure<span class="tooltip">Firm, sustained touch or pressure that can be calming and organizing for the nervous system</span></a>, heavy work with your muscles, or specific movements that provide clear feedback about your body's position and boundaries.</p>

        <p>The <a class="jargon">vestibular system<span class="tooltip">The sensory system in your inner ear that controls balance and spatial orientation</span></a> in your inner ear, which controls balance and spatial orientation, might also process information differently. Some autistic people need more movement - rocking, spinning, or swinging - while others might be sensitive to these movements and prefer stillness. Both patterns can lead to specific <a class="jargon">sensory seeking<span class="tooltip">Actively pursuing specific sensory experiences to help your nervous system feel balanced</span></a> or <a class="jargon">sensory avoiding<span class="tooltip">Avoiding specific sensory experiences that feel overwhelming or uncomfortable</span></a> behaviors.</p>

        <p><a class="jargon">Interoception<span class="tooltip">Your awareness of internal body signals like hunger, thirst, heart rate, and emotional states</span></a> - your awareness of internal body signals - might also work differently, making it harder to recognize stress, emotions, or physical needs until they become intense. <a class="jargon">Stimming<span class="tooltip">Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, rocking, or fidgeting that help regulate emotions and sensory input</span></a> can provide external cues that help you tune into and regulate these internal states.</p>

        <p>The social conflict around stimming exists because <a class="jargon">neurotypical social norms<span class="tooltip">Unwritten rules about behavior and appearance that most non-autistic people follow</span></a> often prioritize appearing calm and controlled over actual regulation and comfort. Many <a class="jargon">repetitive behaviors<span class="tooltip">Actions you repeat that help you self-regulate, focus, or manage emotions</span></a> that are genuinely helpful for autistic nervous systems are interpreted as signs of anxiety, distraction, or social inappropriateness by observers who don't understand their regulatory function.</p>

            <h3>Learn More: The Neuroscience of Self-Regulation â†“</h3>
            <div class="learn-more-content">
                <p>Research by Dr. Ayers and other <a class="jargon">occupational therapists<span class="tooltip">Healthcare professionals who help people engage in daily activities and develop self-regulation skills</span></a> has shown that <a class="jargon">sensory integration<span class="tooltip">How your nervous system receives and organizes sensory information to produce appropriate responses</span></a> challenges are common in autism. The nervous system may be <a class="jargon">hyperresponsive<span class="tooltip">Overly sensitive to sensory input, leading to overwhelm or avoidance</span></a> to some types of input while being <a class="jargon">hyporesponsive<span class="tooltip">Under-responsive to sensory input, leading to seeking more intense stimulation</span></a> to others, sometimes even within the same sensory system.</p>

                <p>Dr. Grandin's research on <a class="jargon">deep pressure therapy<span class="tooltip">The use of firm, sustained pressure to calm the nervous system</span></a> demonstrates that many autistic people benefit from specific types of sensory input that might seem unusual to others but serve important regulatory functions. The <a class="jargon">squeeze machine<span class="tooltip">A device designed by Temple Grandin that provides deep pressure stimulation for calming and regulation</span></a> she developed works on the same principles as many natural stimming behaviors.</p>

                <p>Studies on <a class="jargon">repetitive behaviors<span class="tooltip">Actions you repeat that help you self-regulate, focus, or manage emotions</span></a> in autism show that these movements often correlate with improved attention, reduced anxiety, and better emotional regulation. This suggests that stimming serves important neurological functions rather than being simply "nervous habits" or attention-seeking behaviors.</p>

        <h2 id="next-five-minutes">What Can Help You Through the Next 5 Minutes</h2>
        <p>When you need to regulate right now but are in a situation where stimming freely feels difficult:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use <a class="jargon">covert stims<span class="tooltip">Subtle or hidden self-regulating behaviors that are less noticeable to others</span></a> that work in your current environment:</strong> Press your fingertips together firmly, tense and release muscle groups, roll something small between your fingers, or trace patterns on your leg under a table. These provide <a class="jargon">proprioceptive input<span class="tooltip">Sensory information from your muscles and joints about body position and movement</span></a> without drawing attention.</li>
            <li><strong>Find acceptable movement within social constraints:</strong> Bouncing your foot, shifting in your chair, stretching, or walking to get water are often socially acceptable ways to get movement input when you can't engage in more obvious stimming.</li>
            <li><strong>Use breathing as regulation:</strong> Deep breathing provides <a class="jargon">interoceptive input<span class="tooltip">Sensory information from inside your body, including awareness of breathing, heart rate, and internal states</span></a> and can be done anywhere. Try breathing in for 4 counts, holding for 4, and out for 6 to activate your <a class="jargon">parasympathetic nervous system<span class="tooltip">The part of your nervous system responsible for rest, relaxation, and recovery</span></a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek appropriate sensory input:</strong> If you need deep pressure, press your back firmly against your chair or cross your arms and squeeze. For <a class="jargon">vestibular input<span class="tooltip">Sensory information related to balance and movement</span></a>, gentle head movements or shifting your weight can help when larger movements aren't possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Use objects designed for regulation:</strong> Fidget toys, stress balls, textured jewelry, or even a pen can provide sensory input. Many people find that having something in their hands helps them concentrate and feel more settled.</li>
            <li><strong>Take strategic breaks:</strong> If possible, step outside, visit the bathroom, or find a private space where you can move freely for a few minutes. Even 2-3 minutes of unrestricted movement can help reset your nervous system.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice self-advocacy when safe:</strong> If you're with understanding people, you can simply say "I need to move to concentrate" or "This helps me focus." Many people are more accepting when they understand the purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on regulation over appearance:</strong> Your ability to function is more important than appearing perfectly still or controlled. Find the least disruptive way to meet your sensory needs rather than suppressing them entirely.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Emergency regulation toolkit:</strong> Five quick <a class="jargon">covert stims<span class="tooltip">Subtle or hidden self-regulating behaviors that are less noticeable to others</span></a> you can use anywhere - press palms together firmly, roll your shoulders, clench and release your jaw, trace small circles with your thumb, or shift your weight from foot to foot.</p>

        <h2 id="healthy-long-term-solutions">What Are Some Healthy Long-Term Solutions</h2>
        <p>Building sustainable systems for meeting your <a class="jargon">sensory regulation<span class="tooltip">How your nervous system processes and responds to sensory information to maintain optimal functioning</span></a> needs across different environments:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identify your specific sensory profile:</strong> Learn which types of input help you regulate (deep pressure, movement, textures, sounds) and which tend to overwhelm you. Understanding your patterns helps you seek appropriate input proactively rather than reactively.</li>
            <li><strong>Build a collection of regulation tools for different contexts:</strong> Develop <a class="jargon">stim kits<span class="tooltip">Collections of objects and tools that provide sensory input for regulation</span></a> for work, social situations, and home. Include items like textured objects, fidget tools, weighted lap pads, or noise-canceling headphones.</li>
            <li><strong>Create sensory-friendly spaces in your environment:</strong> Designate areas where you can stim freely - your bedroom, office space, or even just a comfortable chair. Having reliable access to unrestricted movement helps prevent regulation deficits.</li>
            <li><strong>Educate important people in your life:</strong> Help family, friends, and colleagues understand that your <a class="jargon">stimming<span class="tooltip">Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, rocking, or fidgeting that help regulate emotions and sensory input</span></a> serves a function. This reduces judgment and can create more accepting environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop <a class="jargon">sensory diets<span class="tooltip">Planned activities throughout the day that provide the sensory input your nervous system needs</span></a> and preventive regulation:</strong> Include regular movement, deep pressure activities, or other sensory input throughout your day to maintain optimal <a class="jargon">arousal levels<span class="tooltip">Your nervous system's state of alertness and activation</span></a> rather than waiting until you're dysregulated.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice context-switching between regulation strategies:</strong> Learn which environments require more discrete stimming and which allow for more obvious movement. This helps you plan and adapt rather than feeling caught off-guard.</li>
            <li><strong>Build sensory regulation into your routines:</strong> Include movement breaks, deep pressure activities, or other regulatory input as part of your regular schedule. This makes regulation feel normal and necessary rather than disruptive.</li>
            <li><strong>Find movement-friendly activities and communities:</strong> Seek out environments where movement is expected or welcomed - dance, martial arts, fidget-friendly workspaces, or <a class="jargon">neurodivergent communities<span class="tooltip">Groups of people with various neurological differences who understand and accept stimming</span></a> that understand stimming.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop interoceptive awareness skills:</strong> Learn to recognize your early signs of <a class="jargon">dysregulation<span class="tooltip">When your nervous system is out of balance and you need regulatory input</span></a> - tension, restlessness, difficulty concentrating - so you can seek appropriate input before reaching overwhelm.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider workplace and academic accommodations:</strong> Many environments can accommodate fidget tools, movement breaks, or alternative seating. Advocating for your sensory needs often helps others who have similar requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Build relationships with other autistic people:</strong> Connecting with others who understand stimming can provide both social acceptance and practical strategies for regulation in different situations.</li>
        </ul>

            <div class="learn-more-content">
                <p>Research by Morris et al. (2025) found that autistic adults generally experience stimming positively, with negative experiences primarily occurring only when stimming was self-injurious or socially stigmatized. Despite stimming often being a positive experience, participants frequently suppressed it due to social judgment rather than personal discomfort.</p>

                <p>Studies on <a class="jargon">sensory integration<span class="tooltip">How your nervous system receives and organizes sensory information to produce appropriate responses</span></a> show it's now considered an evidence-based practice according to Council for Exceptional Children standards. Research demonstrates that when properly implemented, <a class="jargon">sensory integration<span class="tooltip">How your nervous system receives and organizes sensory information to produce appropriate responses</span></a> interventions can improve daily functioning and reduce regulatory challenges.</p>

                <p>Educational research demonstrates that many students focus better when allowed to move, leading to increased adoption of standing desks, balance balls, and fidget-friendly classrooms in some progressive schools. This suggests that restrictive "sit still and focus" environments may be counterproductive for many people.</p>

        <h2 id="medical-intervention">When Should I Consider Medical Intervention</h2>
        <p>Consider professional support if <a class="jargon">sensory regulation<span class="tooltip">How your nervous system processes and responds to sensory information to maintain optimal functioning</span></a> challenges are significantly impacting your daily functioning:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You're experiencing frequent <a class="jargon">sensory overwhelm<span class="tooltip">When your nervous system receives more sensory input than it can effectively process</span></a> that interferes with work, school, or relationships</li>
            <li><a class="jargon">Sensory sensitivity<span class="tooltip">Being more reactive to sensory input than most people, sometimes to the point of discomfort or overwhelm</span></a> is preventing you from participating in activities or environments you need or want to access</li>
            <li>Suppressing stimming is leading to increased anxiety, depression, or physical tension</li>
            <li>You're injuring yourself through <a class="jargon">stimming behaviors<span class="tooltip">If repetitive behaviors cause physical harm rather than regulation</span></a> - head banging, skin picking to the point of damage, or other harmful repetitive behaviors</li>
            <li><a class="jargon">Sensory seeking behaviors<span class="tooltip">When the pursuit of sensory input becomes dangerous or extremely disruptive</span></a> are becoming dangerous or extremely disruptive to your life</li>
            <li>You're struggling to identify which types of sensory input help versus overwhelm you</li>
            <li><a class="jargon">Meltdowns<span class="tooltip">Intense responses to overwhelming situations that feel out of your control</span></a> or <a class="jargon">shutdowns<span class="tooltip">When you withdraw or become unable to respond normally due to overwhelm</span></a> related to sensory overwhelm are happening frequently</li>
            <li>If you haven't been evaluated for autism and are experiencing significant sensory processing differences, assessment can provide valuable insight and support options</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Look for <a class="jargon">occupational therapists<span class="tooltip">Healthcare professionals who help people engage in daily activities and develop self-regulation skills</span></a> who specialize in <a class="jargon">sensory integration<span class="tooltip">Therapeutic approaches that help your nervous system process sensory information more effectively</span></a> and work from a <a class="jargon">neurodiversity-affirming approach<span class="tooltip">Supporting your natural sensory needs rather than trying to eliminate all stimming</span></a>.

            <p><strong>Types of support that help:</strong> <a class="jargon">Sensory integration therapy<span class="tooltip">Occupational therapy focused on helping your nervous system process sensory information more effectively</span></a>, autism assessment and diagnosis, <a class="jargon">sensory diet development<span class="tooltip">Creating personalized plans for meeting your daily sensory needs</span></a>, environmental modification consultation, and autism-affirming counseling for sensory-related anxiety.</p>

    <div class="validation-section">
        <h2 id="youre-not-imagining-this">You're Not Imagining This</h2>
        <p>Your need for <a class="jargon">stimming<span class="tooltip">Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, rocking, or fidgeting that help regulate emotions and sensory input</span></a> and specific sensory input is real, valid, and neurologically based. These aren't "bad habits" or signs of anxiety that need to be eliminated - they're functional behaviors that help your nervous system operate optimally.</p>

        <p>The judgment you've received about your <a class="jargon">repetitive behaviors<span class="tooltip">Actions you repeat that help you self-regulate, focus, or manage emotions</span></a> reflects social misunderstanding rather than problems with your regulation strategies. Many successful autistic adults continue to stim throughout their lives and find ways to incorporate sensory regulation into their personal and professional environments.</p>

        <p>Your <a class="jargon">sensory processing differences<span class="tooltip">How your nervous system receives and interprets sensory information differently than typical</span></a> are part of your neurological makeup, not character flaws or immaturity. The same nervous system that might need more movement or pressure than others often brings strengths like attention to detail, pattern recognition, or deep focus abilities.</p>

        <p>It's completely understandable to feel frustrated by the conflict between your regulation needs and social expectations. You shouldn't have to choose between feeling comfortable in your body and being accepted by others, though navigating this balance is a real challenge many autistic people face daily.</p>

        <p>The exhaustion that comes from suppressing natural <a class="jargon">self-regulation behaviors<span class="tooltip">Actions that help calm and regulate your emotional and sensory state</span></a> is genuine and can contribute to <a class="jargon">autistic burnout<span class="tooltip">Exhaustion and functional decline from sustained efforts to appear neurotypical</span></a>. Your body and brain function better when allowed to regulate naturally, and seeking environments and relationships that accommodate this is self-advocacy, not self-indulgence.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Your sensory and movement needs are valid neurological requirements, not preferences or habits. While learning to adapt to different social contexts can be helpful, the goal is accommodation and understanding, not elimination of your natural regulation strategies.</p>
