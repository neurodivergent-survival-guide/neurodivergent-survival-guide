                <h2 id="what-this-feels-like">What This Feels Like</h2>
                <p>Your thoughts feel urgent and important, like they need to come out right now before you lose them or the conversation moves on. When someone is talking, your brain is already formulating responses, comments, or related stories that feel like they'll disappear if you don't share them immediately. The space between having a thought and speaking it feels non-existent.</p>
                
                <p>You might find yourself cutting people off mid-sentence, not because you don't care what they're saying, but because your <a class="jargon">impulse control<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to pause and think before acting on immediate urges or reactions</span></a> system struggles to create that pause between thinking and speaking. After interrupting, you often feel embarrassed or frustrated with yourself, knowing you did it again but not understanding why you can't seem to stop.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes you blurt out information that's too personal, inappropriate for the context, or hurtful without meaning to be. The words are out before you've had a chance to consider whether they should be said, leading to <a class="jargon">social awkwardness<span class="tooltip">Uncomfortable social situations that arise from communication differences or timing mismatches</span></a> or hurt feelings that you genuinely didn't intend to cause.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="why-section">
                <h2 id="why-this-happens">Why This Might Be Happening</h2>
                <p><a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> brains have differences in the areas responsible for <a class="jargon">inhibitory control<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to stop automatic responses and think before acting</span></a> - the pause button between thought and action. The <a class="jargon">prefrontal cortex<span class="tooltip">Brain region responsible for executive functions like planning, decision-making, and impulse control</span></a>, which manages these pause-and-think processes, develops more slowly and works differently in people with <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a>.</p>

                <p>Your <a class="jargon">working memory<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily while completing tasks</span></a> might feel limited, creating urgency about expressing thoughts before they disappear. When you have something to say, it can feel like holding onto a slippery fish - if you don't say it immediately, it might be gone forever. This creates a sense of urgency that overrides <a class="jargon">social timing cues<span class="tooltip">Nonverbal signals that indicate when it's appropriate to speak or listen in conversations</span></a>.</p>

                <p>Additionally, <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> brains often process emotions and excitement more intensely, making conversations feel more urgent and engaging. When you're excited about what someone is saying, your brain wants to join the conversation immediately rather than waiting for the socially appropriate moment. <a class="jargon">Dopamine<span class="tooltip">A neurotransmitter that affects motivation, reward, and impulse control</span></a> differences can make the reward of immediate expression feel more compelling than the delayed reward of waiting to speak.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical pause strategies:</strong> Press your lips together, bite your tongue gently, or cover your mouth with your hand to create a physical barrier</li>
                    <li><strong>Note-taking redirect:</strong> Write down your thought instead of saying it - this captures it without interrupting</li>
                    <li><strong>Count to three:</strong> When you feel the urge to speak, silently count "one, two, three" to create a brief pause</li>
                    <li><strong>The apology reset:</strong> If you interrupt, immediately say "Sorry, please continue" and genuinely listen</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical grounding:</strong> Press your feet into the floor or squeeze your hands to redirect the <a class="jargon">impulse energy<span class="tooltip">The physical sensation of urgency that accompanies the need to speak immediately</span></a></li>
                    <li><strong>Silent rehearsal:</strong> Practice your response silently first, which often reduces the urgency to speak immediately</li>
                    <li><strong><a class="jargon">Mindful breathing<span class="tooltip">Focusing on your breath to create space between impulse and action</span></a>:</strong> Take one deep breath before responding to create a natural pause</li>

                <h2 id="healthy-long-term-solutions">What Are Some Healthy Long-Term Solutions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Develop conversation awareness:</strong> Practice noticing <a class="jargon">turn-taking cues<span class="tooltip">Social signals that indicate when it's appropriate to speak in conversations</span></a> like pauses, questioning intonation, or people looking at you</li>
                    <li><strong>Create interruption systems:</strong> Establish signals with close friends or family when you need to jump in, like raising a finger or saying "quick thought"</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice <a class="jargon">active listening<span class="tooltip">Fully focusing on understanding what someone is saying rather than planning your response</span></a>:</strong> Focus entirely on understanding rather than formulating responses while others speak</li>

                <p>Consider professional support if interrupting and blurting is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Significantly damaging important relationships despite your best efforts to control it</li>
                    <li>Creating problems at work or school that affect your livelihood or academic progress</li>
                    <li>Leading to sharing information that violates others' privacy or creates legal issues</li>
                    <li>Causing you significant distress or shame that affects your mental health</li>
                    <li>Getting worse over time despite trying behavioral strategies</li>
                    <li>Accompanied by other concerning <a class="jargon">impulse control<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to pause and think before acting on immediate urges or reactions</span></a> issues like reckless spending or dangerous driving</li>
                    <li>Interfering with your ability to maintain employment or educational opportunities</li>
                    <li>Contributing to <a class="jargon">social isolation<span class="tooltip">Withdrawing from relationships and social situations due to shame or repeated negative interactions</span></a> or avoiding social situations entirely</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>A therapist specializing in <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a></strong> can help you develop personalized strategies for <a class="jargon">impulse management<span class="tooltip">Techniques for improving the pause between thought and action</span></a>. <strong>A psychiatrist</strong> can evaluate whether <a class="jargon">medication<span class="tooltip">Pharmaceutical treatments that can help improve attention and reduce impulsivity</span></a> might help reduce impulsivity.

                <p>Interrupting and blurting are real <a class="jargon">neurological differences<span class="tooltip">Variations in how the brain is structured and functions that create predictable patterns of behavior</span></a> in how your brain processes the gap between thought and speech. This isn't about being rude, selfish, or lacking consideration for others. Your brain genuinely works differently in the <a class="jargon">impulse control<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to pause and think before acting on immediate urges or reactions</span></a> areas, making the pause between thinking and speaking much shorter than it is for <a class="jargon">neurotypical<span class="tooltip">People whose brains develop and function in ways that align with societal expectations and norms</span></a> people.</p>
                
                <p>Many people with <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> describe feeling like their thoughts have urgency that others don't experience. The fear of losing important thoughts or contributions to conversations is real and valid. Learning to work with your brain's patterns rather than fighting them completely can help you develop sustainable communication strategies while honoring your natural enthusiasm and engagement.</p>
                
                <p>Your interrupting often comes from genuine engagement and excitement about the conversation - qualities that many people value even when the timing feels off. The <a class="jargon">social shame<span class="tooltip">Feelings of embarrassment and self-criticism that develop from repeated social misunderstandings</span></a> around interrupting can sometimes be more damaging than the interrupting itself. Good relationships can accommodate some interrupting when people understand it's not intentional rudeness.</p>

                <p>The goal isn't perfect conversation behavior - it's reducing the frequency enough that relationships stay healthy while you remain authentically yourself. Your enthusiasm and quick thinking are strengths that don't need to be eliminated, just channeled more skillfully.</p>
