        <h2 id="what-this-feels-like">What This Feels Like</h2>
        <p><a class="jargon">Missing social cues<span class="tooltip">Not recognizing implicit social signals, subtext, or unspoken communication that others expect you to understand</span></a> feels like everyone else got a social instruction manual that you never received. Conversations feel like puzzles with missing pieces - you understand the words being said, but there's clearly additional meaning happening that you can't access.</p>

        <p>You walk away from interactions feeling unsure whether they went well or poorly. People seem upset or disappointed for reasons you can't identify, or you realize later that plans were apparently made through hints and implications you completely missed. Someone says "We should get coffee sometime" and you think it's a genuine invitation, only to learn it was just <a class="jargon">social pleasantries<span class="tooltip">Polite phrases people say to be nice without intending literal follow-through</span></a>.</p>

        <p>During conflicts, people may say things they don't literally mean - "I hate you," "We're done," or "I never want to see you again" - as <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> rather than factual statements. Taking these declarations at face value can lead to ending relationships that the other person expected to repair.</p>

        <p>Beyond verbal communication, you miss the nonverbal landscape entirely. People's facial expressions seem neutral to you when others read them as obviously frustrated or excited. You might stand closer or farther from people than feels comfortable to them. <a class="jargon">Eye contact<span class="tooltip">Direct gaze between people, often expected in many cultures but can be overwhelming for autistic people</span></a> feels overwhelming, but others interpret your looking away as disinterest.</p>

        <p>Your own <a class="jargon">body language<span class="tooltip">Communication through posture, gestures, and physical positioning</span></a> may not match your internal emotional state - your face might look serious when you're content, or you might gesture in ways that seem odd to others. These mismatches create additional confusion because people are reading your <a class="jargon">nonverbal signals<span class="tooltip">Social information communicated without words through physical presence and movement</span></a> differently than you intend while you're simultaneously missing theirs.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Common experiences:</strong> Realizing conversations had hidden meanings hours later; people seeming annoyed when you ask direct questions; being excluded from plans arranged through hints; taking conflict statements literally; missing <a class="jargon">facial expressions<span class="tooltip">Emotional and social information conveyed through facial movements</span></a> and body language cues; feeling like social interactions are unpredictable guessing games.</p>

    <div class="why-section">
        <h2 id="why-this-happens">Why This Might Be Happening</h2>
        <p>Autistic brains excel at processing explicit, literal information while <a class="jargon">neurotypical communication<span class="tooltip">The communication style used by non-autistic people, which relies heavily on implication and social context</span></a> relies heavily on <a class="jargon">implicit social signals<span class="tooltip">Unspoken communication through tone, timing, context, and assumption of shared social knowledge</span></a>, contextual assumptions, and shared cultural understanding. Your brain processes what people actually say rather than automatically scanning for what they might mean.</p>

        <p>Many <a class="jargon">social cues<span class="tooltip">Nonverbal or implicit signals that convey meaning in social interactions</span></a> depend on reading multiple channels simultaneously - tone of voice, <a class="jargon">body language<span class="tooltip">Communication through posture, gestures, and physical positioning</span></a>, timing, social context, and relationship history. Autistic brains often focus deeply on the content of communication rather than processing these multiple parallel information streams. This isn't a deficit - it's a different pattern of <a class="jargon">information processing<span class="tooltip">How your brain takes in, organizes, and makes sense of information from your environment</span></a>.</p>

        <p><a class="jargon">Eye contact<span class="tooltip">Direct gaze between people, often expected in many cultures but can be overwhelming for autistic people</span></a> presents a particular challenge because it can feel overwhelming sensory-wise while also interfering with your ability to process what someone is saying. For many autistic people, looking at someone's face while listening reduces comprehension rather than improving it.</p>

        <p><a class="jargon">Neurotypical social scripts<span class="tooltip">Unwritten social rules and expected responses that most non-autistic people learn implicitly</span></a> often assume shared understanding of <a class="jargon">social hierarchies<span class="tooltip">Unspoken power dynamics and status relationships that influence how people are expected to communicate</span></a>, <a class="jargon">emotional regulation styles<span class="tooltip">Different ways people manage and express their feelings, often with expectations that others will respond appropriately</span></a>, and <a class="jargon">conflict patterns<span class="tooltip">Predictable ways that arguments and disagreements typically unfold and resolve in relationships</span></a>. Many people expect you to recognize when someone is fishing for reassurance rather than asking a genuine question.</p>

        <p>The <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> aspect of conflict is particularly confusing because it involves people saying things specifically to create emotional impact rather than to convey accurate information. Understanding that people might say "I hate you" to mean "I'm really hurt" requires recognizing that emotional communication often prioritizes feeling expression over factual accuracy.</p>

                <p><a class="jargon">Pragmatic language<span class="tooltip">The social use of language, including understanding context, subtext, and implied meanings</span></a> involves understanding not just what words mean, but how they function in social contexts. <a class="jargon">Theory of mind<span class="tooltip">The ability to understand that others have different thoughts, beliefs, and intentions than your own</span></a> research suggests that autistic people often process others' mental states differently, focusing more on observable behaviors than on inferring hidden intentions.</p>

                <p>Autistic communication tends to prioritize <a class="jargon">informational exchange<span class="tooltip">Communication focused on sharing accurate information and understanding</span></a> while <a class="jargon">neurotypical communication<span class="tooltip">The communication style used by non-autistic people, which relies heavily on implication and social context</span></a> often serves <a class="jargon">social regulation functions<span class="tooltip">Communication that manages relationships, emotions, and social hierarchies rather than just exchanging information</span></a> - managing relationships, emotions, and social status. These different priorities can create communication mismatches even when both people have good intentions.</p>

                <p>Research on <a class="jargon">social cognition<span class="tooltip">Mental processes involved in understanding and navigating social situations</span></a> shows that autistic individuals often have intact or superior abilities to understand explicitly stated social information, but may process <a class="jargon">implicit social context<span class="tooltip">Unspoken social information that's assumed to be understood</span></a> differently. This isn't a limitation - it's a different cognitive style that works well in contexts that value direct, clear communication.</p>

        <h2 id="next-five-minutes">What Can Help You Through the Next 5 Minutes</h2>
        <p>When you're in a confusing social situation right now and suspect you might be missing something:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use clarifying scripts that sound curious, not defensive:</strong> "Help me understand what you mean by..." or "I want to make sure I'm understanding correctly..." or "Can you tell me more about that?" These frame your questions as genuine interest rather than challenge.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for emotional context clues:</strong> If someone seems upset but their words don't match, they might be communicating feelings rather than literal information. Try "Are you OK? You seem upset" or "Is everything alright? You sound stressed."</li>
            <li><strong>Buy yourself thinking time:</strong> "Let me think about that for a second" or "That's interesting, tell me more" gives you space to process without having to respond immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>For nonverbal confusion:</strong> Ask "Help me understand what you're thinking" or "I want to make sure I understand how you're feeling about this - are you frustrated?" Direct questions about emotional state often work better than trying to decode expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove yourself if overwhelmed:</strong> "I need a few minutes to process this" or "Can we continue this conversation later?" You have genuine permission to withdraw from confusing social situations without guilt.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the emergency social script:</strong> "I want to make sure I understand what you're telling me. Can you help me out by being very specific about what you want me to do in this situation?" This frames your need for explicit communication as wanting to be helpful.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="long-term">
        <h2 id="healthy-long-term-solutions">What Are Some Healthy Long-Term Solutions</h2>
        <p>Building sustainable systems for navigating <a class="jargon">implicit communication<span class="tooltip">Communication that relies on unspoken understanding and social context rather than explicit statements</span></a> and social uncertainty:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Develop a library of clarifying questions:</strong> Practice scripts for different situations: "What would you like me to do about that?" "How can I best support you right now?" "Are you looking for advice or just someone to listen?" These help identify what kind of response is expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn to recognize your confusion as valuable information:</strong> When conversations feel unclear or you're unsure how to respond, that confusion often signals that <a class="jargon">subtext<span class="tooltip">The underlying or implicit meaning beneath what's actually being said</span></a> or <a class="jargon">social expectations<span class="tooltip">Unspoken assumptions about how you should behave or respond in social situations</span></a> are at play. Use this as a cue to ask for clarification.</li>
            <li><strong>Build relationships with direct communicators:</strong> Seek out friends, colleagues, and romantic partners who value straightforward communication and are willing to be explicit about their needs and expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Create systems for checking social understanding:</strong> With close friends or family, establish agreements that they'll tell you directly when something is bothering them rather than expecting you to infer it. This reduces guessing games in important relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Study <a class="jargon">conflict patterns<span class="tooltip">Predictable ways that arguments and disagreements typically unfold and resolve</span></a> in your relationships:</strong> Learn which people tend to say things they don't mean when upset, how long their cooling-off periods typically last, and what their repair attempts look like. This helps you recognize <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> vs. genuine relationship threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice pattern recognition for common <a class="jargon">social scripts<span class="tooltip">Standard ways people typically interact in specific situations</span></a>:</strong> "How are you?" is usually a greeting, not a question. "We should hang out sometime" often means "I like you" rather than "Make specific plans with me." "Whatever you want to do is fine" often means "I have a preference but don't want to state it directly."</li>
            <li><strong>Develop self-advocacy for communication differences:</strong> Practice explaining your communication needs directly: "I process information better when I'm not making eye contact" or "My face doesn't show my emotions the way other people's do." This educates others while maintaining your autonomy.</li>
        </ul>

            <div class="learn-more-content">
                <p>While <a class="jargon">social scripting<span class="tooltip">Preparing specific phrases or responses for common social situations</span></a> can be incredibly helpful, it's important to recognize when it's becoming a negative feedback loop. If you find yourself trying to script every possible social contingency, or if the effort of preparation exceeds the energy of the actual interaction, this may indicate that <a class="jargon">social anxiety<span class="tooltip">Fear or worry about social interactions and how others might judge you</span></a> is driving the scripting rather than practical communication needs.</p>

                <p>Healthy scripting focuses on <a class="jargon">clarifying questions<span class="tooltip">Questions that help you understand what someone really means or needs</span></a> and <a class="jargon">conflict de-escalation<span class="tooltip">Techniques for reducing tension and misunderstanding during disagreements</span></a> rather than trying to predict and prepare for every possible social scenario. The goal is to have tools for when you're confused, not to eliminate all social uncertainty.</p>

                <p>If scripting is creating more anxiety than it's solving, this might be a good time to seek support from an <a class="jargon">autism-informed therapist<span class="tooltip">A mental health professional who understands autistic experiences and doesn't try to force neurotypical social behaviors</span></a> or to focus on finding social contexts where less scripting is needed rather than trying to script more effectively.</p>

        <h2 id="medical-intervention">When Should I Consider Medical Intervention</h2>
        <p>Consider professional support if social communication challenges are significantly impacting your life:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a class="jargon">Social anxiety<span class="tooltip">Fear or worry about social interactions and how others might judge you</span></a> is preventing you from engaging in activities or relationships you value</li>
            <li>Constantly missing <a class="jargon">social cues<span class="tooltip">Nonverbal or implicit signals that convey meaning in social interactions</span></a> is affecting your work performance, family relationships, or friendships in ways that cause distress</li>
            <li>You're experiencing depression or isolation due to feeling like you can't connect with others or understand social situations</li>
            <li><a class="jargon">Communication misunderstandings<span class="tooltip">When your intended message and what others receive don't match, causing social problems</span></a> are creating persistent conflicts in important relationships despite good intentions from everyone involved</li>
            <li>You're spending so much energy trying to decode social situations that it's affecting your ability to function in other areas of life</li>
            <li><a class="jargon">Masking<span class="tooltip">Camouflaging your autistic traits to appear more neurotypical in social situations</span></a> efforts to appear socially competent are leading to <a class="jargon">autistic burnout<span class="tooltip">Exhaustion and functional decline from sustained efforts to appear neurotypical</span></a> or identity confusion</li>
            <li>You're avoiding social situations entirely because they feel too unpredictable or stressful</li>
            <li>If you haven't been evaluated for autism and are experiencing significant social communication challenges, comprehensive assessment can provide valuable insight and support options</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Look for <a class="jargon">autism-informed practitioners<span class="tooltip">Professionals who understand autistic experiences and communication differences without trying to force neurotypical behaviors</span></a> who understand that the goal isn't to make you process social information like a neurotypical person, but to develop strategies that work with your natural communication style. <a class="jargon">Social skills training<span class="tooltip">Teaching specific techniques for social interaction, though it should respect autistic communication styles</span></a> can be helpful when it focuses on translation skills rather than forcing <a class="jargon">neurotypical social behaviors<span class="tooltip">Communication styles and social expectations typical of non-autistic people</span></a>.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Types of support that help:</strong> Autism assessment and diagnosis, <a class="jargon">pragmatic language therapy<span class="tooltip">Speech therapy focused on social communication skills while respecting autistic communication patterns</span></a>, autism-affirming counseling, social communication groups, and workplace accommodation consultation.</p>

        <h2 id="validation">You're Not Imagining This</h2>
        <p>Missing social cues is a well-documented aspect of autistic communication that affects millions of people. Your struggles with <a class="jargon">implicit communication<span class="tooltip">Communication that relies on unspoken understanding and social context rather than explicit statements</span></a> aren't about lacking intelligence, empathy, or social motivation - they reflect real differences in how your brain processes complex social information.</p>

        <p>The exhaustion you feel from constantly trying to decode social situations is real and valid. <a class="jargon">Neurotypical people<span class="tooltip">People whose brains develop and function in ways considered typical by society</span></a> often take for granted how much implicit social information they process automatically, making it difficult for them to understand why explicit communication feels necessary to you.</p>

        <p>Your need for direct, clear communication isn't a character flaw or social immaturity. Many successful autistic people continue to prefer explicit communication throughout their lives and build careers and relationships around contexts that value directness and clarity. You speak a different social language, not a wrong one.</p>

        <p>It's common to feel frustrated when well-meaning people tell you to "read between the lines" or "use common sense" without recognizing that the social information they're referencing isn't actually common or sensical - it's culturally specific and often arbitrary. Your preference for literal, accurate communication has value and contributes meaningfully to relationships and communities.</p>

        <p>The confusion you experience around <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> during conflicts is understandable and shared by many autistic people. Taking people at their word isn't naivety - it's treating their communication with respect and accuracy. Learning to recognize when people don't mean what they say literally can be helpful for navigation, but it doesn't mean you need to adopt this communication style yourself.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You speak a different social language, not a wrong one. While learning to "translate" can be helpful, the ultimate goal is finding relationships and contexts where mutual understanding and accommodation make communication easier for everyone involved.</p>
