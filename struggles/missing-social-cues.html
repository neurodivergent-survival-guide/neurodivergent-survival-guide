        <h2 id="what-this-feels-like">What This Feels Like</h2>
        <p><a class="jargon">Missing social cues<span class="tooltip">Not recognizing implicit social signals, subtext, or unspoken communication that others expect you to understand</span></a> often feels like everyone else got a social instruction manual that you never received. Conversations can feel like puzzles with missing pieces - you understand the words being said, but there's clearly additional meaning happening that you can't access.</p>

        <p>You might walk away from interactions feeling unsure whether they went well or poorly. People seem upset or disappointed for reasons you can't identify, or you realize later that plans were apparently made through hints and implications you completely missed. Someone says "We should get coffee sometime" and you think it's a genuine invitation, only to learn it was just <a class="jargon">social pleasantries<span class="tooltip">Polite phrases people say to be nice without intending literal follow-through</span></a>.</p>

        <p>The confusion is often compounded during conflicts. When people are upset, they may say things they don't literally mean - "I hate you," "We're done," or "I never want to see you again" - as <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> rather than factual statements. Taking these declarations at face value can lead to ending relationships that the other person expected to repair through apologies and cooling-off periods.</p>

        <p>You might find yourself constantly analyzing conversations after they happen, trying to figure out what you missed. The <a class="jargon">subtext<span class="tooltip">The underlying or implicit meaning beneath what's actually being said</span></a> that others seem to navigate effortlessly remains invisible to you, leaving you feeling like you're always one step behind in social situations.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Common experiences:</strong> Realizing conversations had hidden meanings hours later; people seeming annoyed when you ask direct questions; being excluded from plans that were arranged through hints; taking conflict statements literally when they were emotional expressions; feeling like social interactions are unpredictable guessing games.</p>

    <div class="why-section">
        <h2 id="why-this-happens">Why This Might Be Happening</h2>
        <p>Autistic brains tend to excel at processing explicit, literal information while <a class="jargon">neurotypical communication<span class="tooltip">The communication style used by non-autistic people, which relies heavily on implication and social context</span></a> relies heavily on <a class="jargon">implicit social signals<span class="tooltip">Unspoken communication through tone, timing, context, and assumption of shared social knowledge</span></a>, contextual assumptions, and shared cultural understanding. Your brain processes what people actually say rather than automatically scanning for what they might mean.</p>

        <p>Many <a class="jargon">social cues<span class="tooltip">Nonverbal or implicit signals that convey meaning in social interactions</span></a> depend on reading multiple channels simultaneously - tone of voice, body language, timing, social context, and relationship history. Autistic brains often focus deeply on the content of communication rather than processing these multiple parallel information streams. This isn't a deficit - it's a different pattern of <a class="jargon">information processing<span class="tooltip">How your brain takes in, organizes, and makes sense of information from your environment</span></a> that prioritizes accuracy and detail over social inference.</p>

        <p><a class="jargon">Neurotypical social scripts<span class="tooltip">Unwritten social rules and expected responses that most non-autistic people learn implicitly</span></a> often assume shared understanding of social hierarchies, emotional regulation styles, and conflict patterns. For example, many people expect you to recognize when someone is fishing for reassurance rather than asking a genuine question, or when criticism is meant to prompt behavioral change rather than provide information.</p>

        <p>The <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> aspect of conflict is particularly confusing because it involves people saying things specifically to create emotional impact rather than to convey accurate information. Understanding that people might say "I hate you" to mean "I'm really hurt and want you to know it" requires recognizing that emotional communication often prioritizes feeling expression over factual accuracy.</p>

                <p><a class="jargon">Pragmatic language<span class="tooltip">The social use of language, including understanding context, subtext, and implied meanings</span></a> involves understanding not just what words mean, but how they function in social contexts. <a class="jargon">Theory of mind<span class="tooltip">The ability to understand that others have different thoughts, beliefs, and intentions than your own</span></a> research suggests that autistic people often process others' mental states differently, focusing more on observable behaviors than on inferring hidden intentions.</p>

                <p>Autistic communication tends to prioritize <a class="jargon">informational exchange<span class="tooltip">Communication focused on sharing accurate information and understanding</span></a> while <a class="jargon">neurotypical communication<span class="tooltip">The communication style used by non-autistic people, which relies heavily on implication and social context</span></a> often serves <a class="jargon">social regulation functions<span class="tooltip">Communication that manages relationships, emotions, and social hierarchies rather than just exchanging information</span></a> - managing relationships, emotions, and social status. These different priorities can create communication mismatches even when both people have good intentions.</p>

                <p>Research on <a class="jargon">social cognition<span class="tooltip">Mental processes involved in understanding and navigating social situations</span></a> shows that autistic individuals often have intact or superior abilities to understand explicitly stated social information, but may process <a class="jargon">implicit social context<span class="tooltip">Unspoken social information that's assumed to be understood</span></a> differently. This isn't a limitation - it's a different cognitive style that works well in contexts that value direct, clear communication.</p>

        <h2 id="next-five-minutes">What Can Help You Through the Next 5 Minutes</h2>
        <p>When you're in a confusing social situation right now and suspect you might be missing something:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use clarifying scripts that sound curious, not defensive:</strong> "Help me understand what you mean by..." or "I want to make sure I'm understanding correctly..." or "Can you tell me more about that?" These frame your questions as genuine interest rather than challenge.</li>
            <li><strong>Acknowledge the confusion directly:</strong> "I'm having trouble reading the situation" or "I feel like I might be missing some context" can invite people to be more explicit without sounding accusatory.</li>
            <li><strong>Buy yourself thinking time:</strong> "Let me think about that for a second" or "That's interesting, tell me more" gives you space to process without having to respond immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for emotional context clues:</strong> If someone seems upset but their words don't match, they might be communicating feelings rather than literal information. Ask "Are you feeling okay?" or "You seem frustrated - is something bothering you?"</li>
            <li><strong>Remove yourself if overwhelmed:</strong> "I need a few minutes to process this" or "Can we continue this conversation later?" protects you from making social mistakes when you're confused and stressed.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on the person's emotional state:</strong> If you can't read the <a class="jargon">subtext<span class="tooltip">The underlying or implicit meaning beneath what's actually being said</span></a>, pay attention to whether they seem happy, sad, frustrated, or worried. This can guide your response even when you don't understand the specific social message.</li>
            <li><strong>Use trusted allies:</strong> If someone you trust is present, you can check in with them later: "Did I miss something in that conversation with Sarah?"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Emergency social script:</strong> "I want to make sure I understand what you're telling me. Could you help me by being a bit more direct about what you need from me?" This frames your need for explicit communication as wanting to be helpful rather than being socially obtuse.</p>

    <div class="long-term">
        <h2 id="healthy-long-term-solutions">What Are Some Healthy Long-Term Solutions</h2>
        <p>Building sustainable systems for navigating <a class="jargon">implicit communication<span class="tooltip">Communication that relies on unspoken understanding and social context rather than explicit statements</span></a> and social uncertainty:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Develop a library of clarifying questions:</strong> Practice scripts for different situations: "What would you like me to do about that?" "How can I best support you right now?" "Are you looking for advice or just someone to listen?" These help identify what kind of response is expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn to recognize your confusion as valuable information:</strong> When conversations feel unclear or you're unsure how to respond, that confusion often signals that <a class="jargon">subtext<span class="tooltip">The underlying or implicit meaning beneath what's actually being said</span></a> or <a class="jargon">social expectations<span class="tooltip">Unspoken assumptions about how you should behave or respond in social situations</span></a> are at play. Use this as a cue to ask for clarification.</li>
            <li><strong>Build relationships with direct communicators:</strong> Seek out friends, colleagues, and romantic partners who value straightforward communication and are willing to be explicit about their needs and expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Create systems for checking social understanding:</strong> With close friends or family, establish agreements that they'll tell you directly when something is bothering them rather than expecting you to infer it. This reduces guessing games in important relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Study <a class="jargon">conflict patterns<span class="tooltip">Predictable ways that arguments and disagreements typically unfold and resolve</span></a> in your relationships:</strong> Learn which people tend to say things they don't mean when upset, how long their cooling-off periods typically last, and what their repair attempts look like. This helps you recognize <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> vs. genuine relationship threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop context-switching skills:</strong> Learn to recognize different social contexts (work meetings vs. casual hangouts vs. family dinners) and the different communication styles expected in each. This helps you adjust your <a class="jargon">social expectations<span class="tooltip">What you anticipate will happen in social interactions based on context</span></a> appropriately.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice pattern recognition for common <a class="jargon">social scripts<span class="tooltip">Standard ways people typically interact in specific situations</span></a>:</strong> "How are you?" is usually a greeting, not a question. "We should hang out sometime" often means "I like you" rather than "Make specific plans with me." "Whatever you want to do is fine" often means "I have a preference but don't want to state it directly."</li>
            <li><strong>Use trusted <a class="jargon">neurotypical allies<span class="tooltip">Non-autistic friends who can help translate social situations and provide cultural context</span></a> as social translators:</strong> Ask friends you trust to help decode confusing interactions: "When David said X, what did he probably mean?" or "What would most people expect me to do in this situation?"</li>

            <h3>Learn More: Managing Social Scripting Without Burnout â†“</h3>
            <div class="learn-more-content">
                <p>While <a class="jargon">social scripting<span class="tooltip">Preparing specific phrases or responses for common social situations</span></a> can be incredibly helpful, it's important to recognize when it's becoming a negative feedback loop. If you find yourself trying to script every possible social contingency, or if the effort of preparation exceeds the energy of the actual interaction, this may indicate that <a class="jargon">social anxiety<span class="tooltip">Fear or worry about social interactions and how others might judge you</span></a> is driving the scripting rather than practical communication needs.</p>

                <p>Healthy scripting focuses on <a class="jargon">clarifying questions<span class="tooltip">Questions that help you understand what someone really means or needs</span></a> and <a class="jargon">conflict de-escalation<span class="tooltip">Techniques for reducing tension and misunderstanding during disagreements</span></a> rather than trying to predict and prepare for every possible social scenario. The goal is to have tools for when you're confused, not to eliminate all social uncertainty.</p>

                <p>If scripting is creating more anxiety than it's solving, this might be a good time to seek support from an <a class="jargon">autism-informed therapist<span class="tooltip">A mental health professional who understands autistic experiences and doesn't try to force neurotypical social behaviors</span></a> or to focus on finding social contexts where less scripting is needed rather than trying to script more effectively.</p>

            <li>Constantly missing <a class="jargon">social cues<span class="tooltip">Nonverbal or implicit signals that convey meaning in social interactions</span></a> is affecting your work performance, family relationships, or friendships in ways that cause distress</li>
            <li>You're experiencing depression or isolation due to feeling like you can't connect with others or understand social situations</li>
            <li><a class="jargon">Communication misunderstandings<span class="tooltip">When your intended message and what others receive don't match, causing social problems</span></a> are creating persistent conflicts in important relationships despite good intentions from everyone involved</li>

            <li><a class="jargon">Masking<span class="tooltip">Camouflaging your autistic traits to appear more neurotypical in social situations</span></a> efforts to appear socially competent are leading to <a class="jargon">autistic burnout<span class="tooltip">Exhaustion and functional decline from sustained efforts to appear neurotypical</span></a> or identity confusion</li>
            <li>You're avoiding social situations entirely because they feel too unpredictable or stressful</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Look for <a class="jargon">autism-informed practitioners<span class="tooltip">Professionals who understand autistic experiences and communication differences without trying to force neurotypical behaviors</span></a> who understand that the goal isn't to make you process social information like a neurotypical person, but to develop strategies that work with your natural communication style. <a class="jargon">Social skills training<span class="tooltip">Teaching specific techniques for social interaction, though it should respect autistic communication styles</span></a> can be helpful when it focuses on translation skills rather than forcing <a class="jargon">neurotypical social behaviors<span class="tooltip">Communication styles and social expectations typical of non-autistic people</span></a>.</p>

        <p><a class="jargon">Missing social cues<span class="tooltip">Not recognizing implicit social signals, subtext, or unspoken communication that others expect you to understand</span></a> is a common autistic experience that reflects different ways of processing communication, not social incompetence or lack of caring. <a class="jargon">Neurotypical communication<span class="tooltip">The communication style used by non-autistic people, which relies heavily on implication and social context</span></a> truly does rely heavily on <a class="jargon">implied meanings<span class="tooltip">Messages that are suggested rather than directly stated</span></a>, <a class="jargon">social context<span class="tooltip">The cultural and situational factors that influence how communication should be interpreted</span></a>, and assumptions about shared understanding that aren't explicitly taught.</p>

        <p>Your confusion about <a class="jargon">emotional performance<span class="tooltip">Expressing feelings through exaggerated or dramatic language for emotional impact rather than literal communication</span></a> during conflicts is completely understandable. Many autistic people struggle with the realization that people sometimes say things they don't mean specifically to create emotional impact rather than to communicate accurate information. Learning that relationships can survive and even strengthen through conflict cycles that include <a class="jargon">emotional outbursts<span class="tooltip">Intense expressions of feeling that may include exaggerated or hurtful language</span></a> and repair is genuinely counterintuitive if you process communication literally.</p>

        <p>You're not missing these <a class="jargon">social cues<span class="tooltip">Nonverbal or implicit signals that convey meaning in social interactions</span></a> because you don't care about people or because you're not trying hard enough. You're processing communication through a system that prioritizes accuracy, logic, and explicit information - which is valuable in many contexts and relationships. The challenge is that you're navigating a social world that often operates on different communication principles.</p>

        <p>Many successful autistic people work in fields and develop relationships where direct, explicit communication is valued and <a class="jargon">social ambiguity<span class="tooltip">Unclear or multiple possible interpretations of social situations</span></a> is minimized. The goal isn't to become neurotypical in your communication processing, but to develop translation skills for when you need them while also finding contexts where your natural communication style is appreciated.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You speak a different social language, not a wrong one. While learning to "translate" can be helpful, the ultimate goal is finding relationships and contexts where mutual understanding and accommodation make communication easier for everyone involved.</p>
