        <h2 id="what-this-feels-like">What This Feels Like</h2>
        <p><a class="jargon">Physical restlessness<span class="tooltip">The need to move your body, fidget, or change positions frequently to maintain focus and comfort</span></a> often feels like having energy constantly bubbling under your skin that needs to escape through movement. Many people describe it as feeling like they'll "crawl out of their skin" if they have to sit still for extended periods.</p>

        <p>You might find yourself constantly shifting positions, bouncing your leg, clicking pens, or playing with whatever objects are within reach. During long meetings or classes, the need to move can become so overwhelming that it's difficult to focus on anything else. <a class="jargon">Fidgeting<span class="tooltip">Small, repetitive movements that help regulate attention and nervous energy</span></a> isn't optional - it feels necessary for your brain to function properly.</p>

        <p>This restlessness often varies throughout the day and can be affected by factors like stress, medication timing, caffeine intake, or how much <a class="jargon">mental stimulation<span class="tooltip">Cognitive engagement and challenge that affects your brain's arousal level</span></a> you're getting from your current activity. Sometimes the movement need feels gentle and manageable, other times it feels urgent and impossible to ignore.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Common experiences:</strong> Leg bouncing, pen clicking, hair twirling; feeling trapped in still environments; pacing while thinking or talking; needing to stand and move during long conversations; using movement to help concentrate.</p>

        <p>Your brain uses <a class="jargon">proprioceptive input<span class="tooltip">Sensory feedback from muscles and joints that helps you know where your body is in space</span></a> and <a class="jargon">vestibular stimulation<span class="tooltip">Input from your inner ear that affects balance and spatial awareness</span></a> from movement to help maintain optimal <a class="jargon">cognitive arousal<span class="tooltip">The level of brain activation needed for optimal functioning and attention</span></a>. <a class="jargon">Fidgeting<span class="tooltip">Small, repetitive movements that help regulate attention and nervous energy</span></a> and restless movement provide the sensory input your <a class="jargon">nervous system<span class="tooltip">Your brain, spinal cord, and nerves that control movement and sensation</span></a> needs to stay alert and focused.</p>

        <p>The <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> brain often seeks additional <a class="jargon">sensory stimulation<span class="tooltip">Input from touch, movement, sound, or other senses that help regulate brain function</span></a> to reach optimal functioning. <a class="jargon">Hyperactivity<span class="tooltip">Excessive movement and restlessness that's driven by neurological differences, not behavior choices</span></a> isn't about having too much energy - it's about your brain's attempt to regulate itself through movement and <a class="jargon">sensory seeking<span class="tooltip">Actively pursuing sensory experiences to help your nervous system function optimally</span></a>.</p>

        <h2 id="next-five-minutes">What Can Help You Through the Next 5 Minutes</h2>
        <p>When you need to move your body right now but are in a situation that requires stillness:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use <a class="jargon">discrete fidgeting<span class="tooltip">Small movements that help you self-regulate without drawing attention from others</span></a>:</strong> Try toe wiggling in shoes, <a class="jargon">isometric exercises<span class="tooltip">Muscle contractions without visible movement, like pressing palms together</span></a> (pressing palms together under desk), or silent finger exercises.</li>
            <li><strong>Engage your <a class="jargon">core muscles<span class="tooltip">Deep abdominal and back muscles that provide stability and can be activated while sitting</span></a>:</strong> Gently engage your abdominal muscles or practice <a class="jargon">postural adjustments<span class="tooltip">Small changes in how you sit or stand that provide proprioceptive input</span></a> while seated to get <a class="jargon">proprioceptive input<span class="tooltip">Sensory feedback from muscles and joints that helps you know where your body is in space</span></a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Use <a class="jargon">fidget tools<span class="tooltip">Objects designed to provide sensory input and movement while maintaining focus</span></a>:</strong> Stress balls, fidget cubes, worry stones, or even a paperclip can provide the <a class="jargon">tactile stimulation<span class="tooltip">Touch-based sensory input that can help regulate your nervous system</span></a> your hands need.</li>
            <li><strong>Take movement micro-breaks:</strong> Stand up and stretch for 30 seconds, do a few jumping jacks in a bathroom, or walk around the block if possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Change your position frequently:</strong> If you must sit, alternate between different sitting positions, use a <a class="jargon">stability ball<span class="tooltip">Exercise ball used as a seat that provides vestibular input and allows for small movements</span></a>, or stand when possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Use <a class="jargon">bilateral movement<span class="tooltip">Activities that engage both sides of your body simultaneously, which can be calming for the nervous system</span></a>:</strong> Cross-lateral movements like marching in place or alternating heel-toe can provide <a class="jargon">neurological regulation<span class="tooltip">Helping your nervous system reach an optimal state of activation and calm</span></a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice <a class="jargon">mindful movement<span class="tooltip">Paying attention to your body's movement needs and responding to them consciously</span></a>:</strong> Notice what type of movement your body is craving and try to provide it in the most socially appropriate way possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Emergency stillness strategy:</strong> If you absolutely must be still, try the "invisible workout" - tense and release muscle groups in sequence, or practice slow, deep breathing while pressing your feet firmly into the floor for <a class="jargon">proprioceptive input<span class="tooltip">Sensory feedback from muscles and joints that helps you know where your body is in space</span></a>.</p>

            <li>Movement needs are preventing you from participating in necessary activities (driving long distances, medical appointments, meetings)</li>

        <p>Many successful people with <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> continue to need movement throughout their lives and build careers and relationships that accommodate this neurological difference.

        <p>Society often treats stillness as a sign of maturity, attention, or respect, but for <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> brains, appropriate movement often enhances rather than detracts from cognitive performance. Your <a class="jargon">fidgeting<span class="tooltip">Small, repetitive movements that help regulate attention and nervous energy</span></a> and restlessness represent your brain's attempt to optimize its function, not disrespect or inattention.</p>

        <p>The shame many people feel about needing to move, especially in professional or academic settings, can lead to <a class="jargon">masking<span class="tooltip">Suppressing natural neurological needs and behaviors to appear more socially acceptable</span></a> that actually reduces your cognitive performance.
