            <h4>What this feels like:</h4>
            <p>After social interactions, many people experience complete mental and physical drainage - like all energy has been consumed. Even enjoyable conversations can leave someone needing hours to recover. This might include mental fog, emotional rawness, or physical exhaustion. Some individuals need to isolate for extended periods to feel balanced again.</p>

            <h4>Why this might be happening:</h4>
            <p>Social interactions often require intense <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Mental energy used for thinking, processing, and decision-making">cognitive resources</span>. Many people simultaneously process spoken content, monitor body language, manage personal responses, and often engage in <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Camouflaging natural neurodivergent behaviors to appear more neurotypical">masking</span> behaviors. This constant mental multitasking can be genuinely exhausting for some <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Different ways brains are wired and process information">neurotypes</span>.</p>

                <li>Add <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Words or phrases that make direct communication feel less harsh or blunt">softening phrases</span>: "I might be wrong, but..." or "What do you think about..."</li>
                <li>Acknowledge the person's perspective: "I can see this is important to you, and..."</li>
                <li>Ask before giving feedback: "Would you like my thoughts on this?"</li>
                <li>Use "I" statements: "I noticed..." instead of "You always..."</li>
                <li>Add appreciation: "Thanks for bringing this up, I think..."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What are some healthy long-term approaches:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn which relationships value directness and which prefer more cushioned communication</li>
                <li>Practice adding one softening phrase to important communications</li>
                <li>Seek work and social environments that appreciate straightforward communication</li>
                <li>Build relationships with other direct communicators</li>
                <li>Remember that adapting communication style is translation, not hiding authentic self</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>When should I consider professional intervention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If communication style consistently damages important relationships</li>
                <li>If receiving repeated workplace feedback about communication approach</li>
                <li>If seeking professional communication coaching</li>
                <li>If directness stems from <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Difficulty controlling immediate responses and actions">impulse control challenges</span> affecting other life areas</li>
                <li>If communication differences significantly impact career or relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>This experience is real:</h4>
            <p>Direct communication is efficient, honest, and valuable. Many cultures and professional environments appreciate straightforward communication. The challenge involves learning when to adapt communication style for specific contexts while maintaining authentic voice. Honesty remains a strength, even when it requires <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Adapting your natural communication style to match different social contexts without losing authenticity">social translation</span> in certain situations.</p>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h4>What this feels like:</h4>
            <p>Many people have perfect responses or important thoughts that feel urgent to share immediately, because waiting means the thought might be lost. Jumping into conversations happens naturally, only to realize afterward that someone was interrupted mid-sentence. The intention is meaningful contribution while thoughts remain accessible, not rudeness.</p>

            <h4>Why this might be happening:</h4>
            <p><span class="jargon-term" data-definition="The ability to temporarily hold and work with information in your mind">Working memory</span> challenges can make thoughts feel urgent and temporary. Additionally, some people process <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Understanding when it's appropriate to speak or remain quiet in social situations">conversation timing patterns</span> differently, missing subtle signals that indicate when it's appropriate to speak. Enthusiasm to engage positively in conversations is valuable, but timing needs adjustment.</p>

            <h4>What can help through the next 5 minutes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Write thoughts down to preserve them, then wait for natural pauses</li>
                <li>Hold up one finger to signal "I have something to add" without speaking</li>
                <li>Count to two after someone stops talking before responding</li>
                <li>If interruption happens, quickly say "Sorry, please continue" and wait</li>
                <li>Focus on listening completely to their point before forming responses</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What are some healthy long-term approaches:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice the "notepad method" - always have something to jot thoughts during conversations</li>
                <li>Ask friends to give specific signals when interruptions occur</li>
                <li>In meetings, establish that writing thoughts down helps participation</li>
                <li>Work on strengthening <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="The ability to temporarily hold and work with information in your mind">working memory</span> through exercises and strategies</li>
                <li>Find conversation partners who understand different communication styles</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>When should I consider professional intervention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If interrupting severely impacts work meetings or important relationships</li>
                <li>If part of broader impulse control challenges affecting multiple life areas</li>
                <li>If seeking medication evaluation for ADHD symptoms including <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Speaking or acting quickly without fully considering the consequences">conversational impulsivity</span></li>
                <li>If working memory issues significantly interfere with daily functioning</li>
                <li>If interrupting patterns create significant social or professional problems</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>This experience is real:</h4>
            <p>The urge to speak immediately when having thoughts reflects genuine differences in information processing and storage. Eagerness to contribute to conversations demonstrates care about connecting with others. Learning timing strategies doesn't mean suppressing voice - it means ensuring valuable contributions are heard and appreciated effectively.</p>

            <h4>What this feels like:</h4>
            <p>When someone speaks, determining whether they're joking, being sarcastic, or serious can be challenging. Sometimes laughter happens at inappropriate moments, or jokes are taken literally. Text messages feel especially confusing because <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Vocal clues about emotion and meaning conveyed through how words are spoken">tone information</span> is completely absent. Questions like "Wait, are you being serious?" are frequently necessary.</p>

            <h4>Why this might be happening:</h4>
            <p>Tone carries significant social meaning that isn't contained in actual words. Some individuals naturally focus more on literal content than <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="The underlying emotional and relational meaning in communication beyond just the words">emotional subtext</span>, or process auditory information in ways that make <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Subtle variations in voice tone that indicate emotion, sarcasm, or intent">tonal nuances</span> less apparent. Cultural differences in tonal expression add additional complexity.</p>

            <h4>What can help through the next 5 minutes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask directly: "Are you joking?" or "How should I interpret that?"</li>
                <li>Pay attention to facial expressions as well as voice tone</li>
                <li>When uncertain, respond neutrally until getting more context</li>
                <li>In text conversations, ask for clarification or use emojis to convey personal tone</li>
                <li>Remember that misreading tone happens to everyone occasionally</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What are some healthy long-term approaches:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Build relationships with people who communicate intentions clearly</li>
                <li>Practice identifying different tones in low-stakes situations (movies, audiobooks)</li>
                <li>Ask trusted friends to be explicit about tone when discussing important topics</li>
                <li>Develop phrases for checking understanding: "I want to make sure I'm reading this right..."</li>
                <li>Accept that occasional tone misreading is normal and happens to most people</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>When should I consider professional intervention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If tone misreading causes significant problems in important relationships</li>
                <li>If part of broader <span class="jargon-term" data-definition="Difficulty processing and understanding spoken language and sounds">auditory processing challenges</span></li>

                <li>If tone misreading significantly impacts work or social functioning</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>This experience is real:</h4>
            <p>Tone is genuinely complex and often ambiguous. Many people misread tone regularly, and cultural differences create additional complexity. Difficulty with tonal nuances reflects different ways of processing social information, not poor social skills. Clear, direct communication benefits everyone in social interactions.</p>
