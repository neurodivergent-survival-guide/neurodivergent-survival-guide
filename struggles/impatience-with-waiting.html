        <h2 id="what-this-feels-like">What This Feels Like</h2>
        <p>Waiting feels physically uncomfortable rather than just mildly annoying. Standing in line, waiting for websites to load, or sitting through slow explanations creates an internal sense of urgency and <a class="jargon">restlessness<span class="tooltip">Physical and mental need for movement or stimulation when forced to be still</span></a> that builds rapidly. Your body wants to move, your mind starts racing, and the passage of time feels distorted and endless.</p>
        
        <p>You might find yourself <a class="jargon">fidgeting<span class="tooltip">Small, repetitive movements like tapping, bouncing, or shifting that help regulate restless energy</span></a> intensely, checking your phone repeatedly, or feeling genuine anxiety about how long something is taking. The delay itself becomes the focus rather than whatever you're waiting for. Small delays that others barely notice can trigger disproportionate frustration or even <a class="jargon">panic responses<span class="tooltip">Fight-or-flight reactions that feel overwhelming in response to situations that aren't actually dangerous</span></a>.</p>
        
        <p>When forced to wait without <a class="jargon">stimulation<span class="tooltip">Mental or sensory input that keeps the ADHD brain engaged and regulated</span></a>, your brain might start creating its own entertainment through <a class="jargon">internal hyperactivity<span class="tooltip">Mental restlessness where thoughts race or jump around when external stimulation is insufficient</span></a> - racing thoughts, mental rehearsals of conversations, or <a class="jargon">catastrophic thinking<span class="tooltip">Mind jumping to worst-case scenarios or imagining negative outcomes during uncertain waiting periods</span></a> about why things are taking so long. The waiting period becomes mentally exhausting rather than restful.</p>

    <div class="why-section">
        <h2 id="why-this-happens">Why This Might Be Happening</h2>
        <p><a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> brains often have differences in <a class="jargon">dopamine regulation<span class="tooltip">The brain's system for processing reward, motivation, and pleasure-seeking behaviors</span></a> and <a class="jargon">time perception<span class="tooltip">How your brain processes and estimates the passage of time</span></a>. Waiting periods provide little stimulation for a brain that needs regular <a class="jargon">dopamine hits<span class="tooltip">Small rewards or interesting stimuli that help maintain attention and mood</span></a> to feel regulated and focused. Without sufficient stimulation, your brain seeks it through movement, mental activity, or emotional intensity.</p>

        <p><a class="jargon">Time blindness<span class="tooltip">Difficulty accurately estimating how much time tasks will take or how much time has passed</span></a> can make waiting periods feel unpredictably long. When you can't estimate how long something will take, your brain defaults to assuming it might be forever, triggering urgency and <a class="jargon">escape responses<span class="tooltip">The urge to flee or avoid situations that feel uncomfortable or threatening to your nervous system</span></a>. The uncertainty about duration creates more distress than the actual waiting time.</p>

        <p>Your <a class="jargon">nervous system<span class="tooltip">The brain and nerves that control thoughts, feelings, and body responses</span></a> might interpret forced stillness as a threat, activating <a class="jargon">fight-or-flight responses<span class="tooltip">The body's automatic reaction to perceived threats, involving increased heart rate, alertness, and urge to move</span></a>. For brains wired for movement and stimulation, being forced to remain still without adequate mental engagement can feel genuinely distressing rather than just boring. This creates a <a class="jargon">physiological stress response<span class="tooltip">Body's physical reaction to perceived threat including increased heart rate, muscle tension, and stress hormones</span></a> to what others experience as neutral waiting.</p>

        <h2 id="youre-not-imagining-this">You're Not Imagining This</h2>
        <p>Impatience with waiting reflects real differences in how your brain processes time, <a class="jargon">stimulation needs<span class="tooltip">The amount of mental and sensory input required for your brain to feel comfortable and regulated</span></a>, and <a class="jargon">impulse control<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to pause and think before acting on immediate urges or reactions</span></a>. This isn't about being spoiled, impatient, or lacking self-control. Your <a class="jargon">nervous system<span class="tooltip">The brain and nerves that control thoughts, feelings, and body responses</span></a> genuinely experiences waiting differently than <a class="jargon">neurotypical<span class="tooltip">People whose brains develop and function in ways that align with societal expectations and norms</span></a> people do.</p>
        
        <p>Many people with <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> describe waiting as physically uncomfortable rather than just mentally boring. The restlessness, <a class="jargon">time distortion<span class="tooltip">When time feels like it's moving much slower or faster than it actually is</span></a>, and urgency you feel are real <a class="jargon">neurological responses<span class="tooltip">How your brain and nervous system automatically react to situations based on their wiring</span></a>, not character flaws or signs of immaturity.</p>
        
        <p>Learning strategies to make waiting more comfortable isn't about forcing yourself to be patient like others - it's about working with your brain's need for <a class="jargon">stimulation<span class="tooltip">Mental or sensory input that keeps the ADHD brain engaged and regulated</span></a> and movement. The goal is reducing distress during necessary waits while accommodating your natural need for engagement and activity. Your brain's impatience often signals intelligence and efficiency - the desire for things to happen quickly can be a strength in many situations.</p>
