            <h2>What This Feels Like</h2>
            <p><a class="jargon">Akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> is a <a class="jargon">movement disorder<span class="tooltip">Neurological conditions that affect the speed, fluency, quality, and ease of movement</span></a> that creates an overwhelming sense of inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move. Unlike typical restlessness, this feels like your body is fighting against stillness at a cellular level.</p>

            <p>Many people describe it as feeling like they need to "crawl out of their own skin" or that sitting still is physically painful. It's not anxiety in the traditional sense - it's a physical compulsion that feels like electricity or insects under your skin. You might find yourself pacing compulsively, rocking back and forth, or constantly shifting positions without relief.</p>

            <p>This condition is most commonly caused by medications, particularly <a class="jargon">antipsychotics<span class="tooltip">Medications used to treat psychosis, bipolar disorder, and sometimes severe depression or anxiety</span></a>, but can also result from <a class="jargon">anti-nausea medications<span class="tooltip">Drugs like metoclopramide or prochlorperazine that can block dopamine receptors</span></a>, certain antidepressants, or <a class="jargon">medication withdrawal<span class="tooltip">The period when stopping or reducing psychiatric medications, which can trigger movement disorders</span></a>.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Common experiences:</strong> Feeling like you can't sit through meals, meetings, or conversations; needing to pace constantly; feeling tormented by the inability to get comfortable; describing the sensation as "crawling out of your skin."</p>

            <h2>Why This Might Be Happening</h2>
            <p><a class="jargon">Akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> occurs when medications block <a class="jargon">dopamine receptors<span class="tooltip">Brain cell receptors that respond to dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for movement control and motivation</span></a> in the brain areas that control movement. This creates a neurochemical imbalance that manifests as an irresistible urge to move. It's not psychological - it's a real neurological <a class="jargon">side effect<span class="tooltip">Unintended effects of medication that occur alongside the intended therapeutic effects</span></a>.</p>

            <p>The brain's <a class="jargon">basal ganglia<span class="tooltip">Brain structures that help control movement, balance, and coordination</span></a> rely on precise <a class="jargon">dopamine<span class="tooltip">A neurotransmitter that helps control movement, motivation, and pleasure</span></a> signaling to regulate movement and stillness. When medications interfere with this system, particularly by blocking <a class="jargon">D2 dopamine receptors<span class="tooltip">Specific dopamine receptors in the brain that are crucial for movement control</span></a>, the brain loses its ability to feel comfortable at rest.</p>

            <p>Certain people are more vulnerable to developing <a class="jargon">akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a>, including those with <a class="jargon">iron deficiency<span class="tooltip">Low iron levels that can increase susceptibility to movement disorders</span></a>, elderly individuals, women, and people taking higher doses or multiple medications that affect <a class="jargon">dopamine<span class="tooltip">A neurotransmitter that helps control movement, motivation, and pleasure</span></a>.</p>

            <h2>What Can Help You Through the Next 5 Minutes</h2>
            <p>When you're experiencing <a class="jargon">akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> right now, these strategies can provide some relief:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Allow yourself to move:</strong> Don't fight the urge to pace, rock, or shift positions. Fighting the compulsion typically makes it worse and increases distress.</li>
                <li><strong>Try gentle movement:</strong> Walking, stretching, or doing gentle exercises can sometimes help channel the restless energy in a more organized way.</li>
                <li><strong>Use cooling techniques:</strong> A cool compress on your neck, face, or wrists while moving can provide some sensory relief.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice breathing while moving:</strong> Don't force yourself to sit still for breathing exercises - practice <a class="jargon">deep breathing<span class="tooltip">Slow, controlled breathing that can help calm the nervous system</span></a> while pacing or rocking.</li>
                <li><strong>Remind yourself this is medical:</strong> The distress you're feeling is a medication <a class="jargon">side effect<span class="tooltip">Unintended effects of medication that occur alongside the intended therapeutic effects</span></a>, not anxiety or a mental health crisis. This can help reduce panic about the sensations.</li>
                <li><strong>Use distraction while moving:</strong> Listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks while pacing. Mental distraction combined with allowed movement can reduce suffering.</li>
                <li><strong>Try different positions:</strong> Alternate between sitting, standing, and lying down. Some people find that certain positions or movements provide temporary relief.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Emergency comfort measure:</strong> If possible, take a warm shower or bath while the water runs over you. The combination of warmth, movement, and sensory input can provide temporary relief for some people.</p>

            <p>Managing <a class="jargon">akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> requires medical intervention, but these approaches can help:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contact your prescribing doctor immediately:</strong> <a class="jargon">Akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> is a serious <a class="jargon">side effect<span class="tooltip">Unintended effects of medication that occur alongside the intended therapeutic effects</span></a> that requires professional medical attention. Don't try to tough it out.</li>
                <li><strong>Request medication adjustments:</strong> Options include dose reduction, switching to a different medication, or adding <a class="jargon">anticholinergic medications<span class="tooltip">Drugs like benztropine that can counteract movement side effects by balancing brain chemicals</span></a> to counteract the movement effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask about specific treatments:</strong> <a class="jargon">Propranolol<span class="tooltip">A beta-blocker medication that can help reduce akathisia symptoms in some people</span></a>, <a class="jargon">benzodiazepines<span class="tooltip">Anti-anxiety medications that may provide short-term relief from akathisia</span></a>, or <a class="jargon">mirtazapine<span class="tooltip">An antidepressant that may help with medication-induced movement disorders</span></a> may help reduce symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep a movement diary:</strong> Track when symptoms are worst, what helps or makes them worse, and any patterns related to medication timing or activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Advocate for yourself persistently:</strong> <a class="jargon">Akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> is often dismissed as "just anxiety" but requires specific treatment approaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Create movement-friendly environments:</strong> Arrange your living and work spaces to accommodate pacing and movement. Use standing desks, walking meetings, or areas where restless movement is acceptable.</li>

            <p>Seek immediate medical attention for <a class="jargon">akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> in these situations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Severe distress or <a class="jargon">suicidal thoughts<span class="tooltip">Thoughts of self-harm that can occur when akathisia becomes unbearable</span></a>:</strong> <a class="jargon">Akathisia<span class="tooltip">A movement disorder characterized by inner restlessness and an irresistible urge to move</span></a> can be so distressing that people consider self-harm.
