# ENHANCED NEURODIVERGENT SURVIVAL GUIDE: COMPLETE TECHNICAL STANDARDS

## PRIMARY PURPOSE (MANDATORY)

### Core Purpose Guiding Principle

The primary purpose of struggle pages is to serve as a practical survival guide for people experiencing difficulties in their daily lives. When someone reads "What This Feels Like" and recognizes themselves, they should be able to learn about how this struggle manifests, gain self-understanding, and discover actionable ways to channel their energy more effectively to improve their lives. The immediate coping strategies function like a survival guide for urgent moments, while long-term solutions help people reduce or eliminate the struggle from their lives entirely. All content should prioritize practical help over academic depth.

---

## CORE VOICE PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)

### Authentic but not presumptuous
Write from lived neurodivergent experience while respecting individual variation. Use "some people find," "many experience," and "you might notice" rather than "you will feel" or universal statements. Avoid generalizing your patterns to all readers - neurodivergent experiences span enormous diversity, and what's true for one person may not apply to another. Acknowledge when experiences vary significantly between individuals, conditions, or life circumstances. Present information as possibilities rather than certainties.

### Clinically neutral
Reject both medical deficit language ("impairments," "symptoms," "dysfunctions," "disorders") and wellness-culture reframing ("superpowers," "gifts," "just wired differently," "neurodivergent advantage"). Present neurodivergence as neurological variations that create predictable friction with systems designed for different brains. Neither pathology requiring cure nor advantage to celebrate - simply brain differences with real-world impacts that require practical accommodation and understanding.

### Accessible without condescension
Write clearly and directly without dumbing down content or talking down to readers. Use concrete examples, define specialized terms upon introduction, and structure information logically. Assume readers are intelligent adults who deserve straightforward information and respect their ability to understand complex concepts when properly explained. Avoid academic jargon while maintaining intellectual honesty and depth.

### Measured validation without catastrophizing
Describe neurodivergent struggles as genuinely difficult emotional experiences without using physical violence metaphors ("punch to the gut," "stabbed," "attacked"), disaster language ("catastrophic," "devastating," "unbearable"), or life-threatening comparisons ("survival," "emergency," "life-or-death"). Use calibrated language like "challenging," "difficult," "intense," "very hard" that validates real struggle without suggesting imminent danger. Frame experiences as emotional discord requiring support and understanding, not crises requiring rescue. Match the internal dialogue people actually have rather than clinical extremes or dramatic interpretations.

### Research attribution and medical boundaries
Always attribute research claims and statistics to specific researchers, institutions, or studies rather than presenting them as established universal fact. Use phrases like "According to Dr. [Name]'s research," "Studies by [Institution] found," or "[Researcher]'s clinical experience suggests" rather than "Research shows" or "Studies prove." When discussing medications, reference drug families and classes only ("ADHD stimulants," "alpha-2 receptor agonists," "antidepressants") rather than specific drug names to prevent medication-seeking behavior where patients shop for doctors to prescribe specific drugs. Therapeutic interventions (like "transcranial direct current stimulation" or "cognitive behavioral therapy") are appropriate to name specifically since patients can appropriately ask about these treatment options.

### Realistic struggle language
Use search terms and emotional descriptions that match how people actually think and talk about their experiences in private moments. Search terms should be 2-4 words maximum, capturing the immediate, frustrated internal dialogue ("can't focus," "so sensitive," "brain won't cooperate") rather than clinical descriptions or lengthy explanations. Avoid dramatic escalation in describing everyday neurodivergent challenges - most struggles are chronic difficulties that require support, not acute emergencies requiring intervention.

### Jargon Tooltip Standards
Provide objective, neutral definitions that explain what terms mean rather than justifying behaviors or providing therapeutic perspective. Use dictionary-style language: "Procrastination: Delaying or putting off tasks until later" rather than "Procrastination: Delaying tasks not out of laziness but due to brain differences." Focus on what the term actually means, not on making the reader feel better about experiencing it.

## NUMBERS AND COUNTS (MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS)

**CRITICAL VARIATION PRINCIPLE:** When creating content, intentionally vary numerical choices within allowed ranges. Do not default to maximum values. Mix it up: sometimes use 5 coping strategies, sometimes 7, sometimes 6. Use 19 jargon tooltips in one article, 23 in another. This creates more natural, less formulaic content.

### Required Counts
- **Total word count:** 1,000-1,500 words (for sections 1, 2, 5, 6 only)
- **Coping strategies:** 5-8 per section (vary between articles - don't always use 8)
- **Jargon tooltips:** 18-25 per page (intentionally vary the count)
- **Related struggles:** Either 4 or 5 links (not 3, not 6)
- **Search terms:** 6-8 terms, each 2-4 words maximum
- **Learn More sections:** 0-3 per article (only where they add value)

### Word Count Breakdown
- **Section 1** (What This Feels Like): 300-400 words
- **Section 2** (Why This Might Be Happening): 200-300 words
- **Section 3** (Next 5 Minutes): Not counted (5-8 strategies)
- **Section 4** (Long-term Solutions): Not counted (5-8 strategies)
- **Section 5** (Medical Intervention): 200-300 words
- **Section 6** (Validation): 200-400 words

## CONTENT STRUCTURE STANDARDS

### Struggle Pages Structure (EXACT sequence required)

1. **What This Feels Like** (phenomenology, not clinical description)
2. **Why This Might Be Happening** (mechanisms without excessive technical detail)
3. **What Can Help You Through the Next 5 Minutes** (immediate, safe interventions)
   - 5-8 strategies (vary the count)
   - Mechanism-specific: must directly address the neurological/psychological state driving this particular struggle
   - Immediately actionable: can be implemented within minutes while actively experiencing the struggle
   - State-compatible: works WITH the current brain activation level, not against it
   - Concrete and specific: avoid vague advice like "practice self-care"
   - Quality filter: Would this advice be different for other struggles? (eliminates generic recommendations)

4. **What Are Some Healthy Long-Term Solutions** (sustainable approaches)
   - 5-8 strategies (vary the count)
   - Evidence-backed: supported by research, clinical experience, or documented lived experience patterns
   - Systems-focused: changes environment, habits, or life structure rather than requiring constant willpower
   - Skill-building: develops capabilities that reduce struggle frequency or intensity over time
   - Life integration: addresses how the struggle interacts with work, relationships, health, or major life domains
   - Sustainability focus: realistic for long-term implementation without constant maintenance
   - Quality filter: Does this address root causes or just symptoms?

5. **When Should I Consider Medical Intervention** (clear red flags)
6. **You're Not Imagining This** (validation and normalization)
7. **Related Struggles** (cross-links to either 4 or 5 related struggle pages)

### Section Content Guidelines

**What This Feels Like:** Describe the phenomenon in various details so that the entire range of the struggle can be understood and people can "find themselves". This section must use the page title within it somewhere as a jargon term. Consider ending with a "Common experiences" highlight box (semicolon-separated list of 4-6 examples), but vary endings between articles - sometimes use a different type of highlight box, sometimes end with a regular paragraph, sometimes with a particularly vivid description.

**Why This Might Be Happening:** Explain the differences in neurodivergent brains that cause this effect, running through the various mechanisms at play. This section commonly includes Learn More sections since the science is often strong here.

**Medical Intervention:** Begin with "Consider professional support if [struggle] is significantly impacting your life:" followed by a list of red flags. Include wrapping text about how medical intervention can reduce or eliminate the struggle, guiding readers to appropriate licensed care.

**Validation:** Begin by validating the experience, reframe the struggle as something that can be worked with rather than fought against, and highlight how the same neurological differences can be strengths in different contexts.

---

## LEARN MORE SECTIONS

### Purpose
Learn More sections explain the science behind struggles, providing research-backed context without overwhelming the main narrative.

### Placement Guidelines
- **Most common:** Section 2 (Why This Might Be Happening) - explaining mechanisms
- **Sometimes useful:** Section 4 (Long-term Solutions) - professional support options
- **Occasionally appropriate:** Section 1 (What This Feels Like) - explaining why something feels a specific way
- **Rarely needed:** Section 6 (Validation) - only for explaining why struggles are predictable/unchangeable (e.g., Interest-Based Nervous System)
- **Generally avoid:** Sections 3 and 5 unless specifically relevant

### Content Requirements
- 3-4 paragraphs maximum
- One clear, specific claim per Learn More
- Attribution to specific researchers/institutions
- Simple language focused on practical implications
- Include research from cognitive science, neuroscience, or behavioral studies

## MANDATORY FRONT MATTER SCHEMA

### All Fields Required

```yaml
---
layout: struggle
title: "Page Title"
subtitle: "Descriptive subtitle"
description: "SEO meta description (150 chars max)"
slug: page-slug-name
condition: autism          # adhd/autism/bipolar/bpd/ocd

# Tag System (Mandatory)
tags:
  experience: [stuck, frustrated]      # 1-2 tags from experience list
  functional: [organization, energy]   # 1-2 tags from functional list
  context: [work, pressure]            # 1-3 tags from context list
  condition: [autism]                  # MUST match the condition field above

# Content Management (Mandatory)
status: published          # published/draft - for staging/kill switches
featured: false            # true/false - for main page curation

# SEO Optimization (Mandatory)
search_terms: ["user language searches", "frustrated phrases", "problem descriptions"]
---
```

---

## SEARCH TERMS IMPLEMENTATION: REAL STRUGGLE LANGUAGE

**Keep them SHORT:** 2-4 words maximum. People type short, frustrated queries, not descriptive sentences.

### Use emotional, immediate language
- ✅ "stuck again"
- ❌ "experiencing task initiation difficulties"

### Focus on the struggle moment
- ✅ "brain dead"
- ❌ "cognitive challenges interfering with productivity"

### Target frustrated self-talk
- ✅ "so lazy"
- ❌ "experiencing motivational differences"

Include **6-8 SHORT terms** per page - what someone types when they're struggling right now, not how they'd describe it to a therapist later.

---

## LAYOUT ARCHITECTURE: CONTENT GUIDELINES

### Table of Contents
**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** TOC is autogenerated by layout - do NOT include in individual struggle page content.

### Navigation
Navigation is handled by layout using CSS Grid for perfect center alignment regardless of button text length.
