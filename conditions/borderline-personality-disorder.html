<p><strong><a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)</strong> involves brain differences in <a class="jargon">attention regulation<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to direct and sustain focus where you want it, when you want it</span></a>, <a class="jargon">impulse control<span class="tooltip">The ability to pause and think before acting on immediate urges or responses</span></a>, and <a class="jargon">executive function<span class="tooltip">The brain's management system that handles planning, organization, time management, task initiation, and follow-through</span></a>. These differences create predictable friction with environments designed for <a class="jargon">neurotypical<span class="tooltip">People whose brains develop and function in ways that align with societal expectations and norms</span></a> attention patterns and organization systems.</p>

<p>People with <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> often have intense focus when interested (<a class="jargon">hyperfocus<span class="tooltip">Periods of intense concentration on engaging activities, often at the expense of other tasks or awareness of time</span></a>) but struggle with sustained attention on less engaging tasks. This creates a pattern of exceptional performance in some areas while facing significant challenges in others, particularly with traditional academic and workplace structures.</p>

    <strong>Reframing ADHD:</strong> Traditional descriptions focus on <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> as a "deficit" in attention and hyperactivity "disorder." A more accurate understanding recognizes it as brain differences that create challenges with <a class="jargon">interest-based attention<span class="tooltip">Attention system that focuses intensely on engaging, rewarding, or novel activities but struggles with boring tasks</span></a> systems in environments designed for <a class="jargon">willpower-based attention<span class="tooltip">The ability to force focus on tasks through discipline and self-control, regardless of interest level</span></a>. Think of <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> brains as having a different type of attention - one that works incredibly well when engaged and interested, but struggles when forced to focus on tasks that don't provide enough <a class="jargon">stimulation<span class="tooltip">Mental or sensory input that captures attention and maintains engagement</span></a>.

<p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Attention and Focus:</strong> <a class="jargon">Interest-based attention<span class="tooltip">Attention system that focuses intensely on engaging, rewarding, or novel activities but struggles with boring tasks</span></a> that works differently than <a class="jargon">neurotypical<span class="tooltip">People whose brains develop and function in ways that align with societal expectations and norms</span></a> <a class="jargon">willpower-based focus<span class="tooltip">The ability to force focus on tasks through discipline and self-control, regardless of interest level</span></a> systems. This includes intense focus when interested (<a class="jargon">hyperfocus<span class="tooltip">Periods of intense concentration on engaging activities, often at the expense of other tasks or awareness of time</span></a>), difficulty sustaining attention on boring tasks, mind wandering during unstimulating activities, <a class="jargon">distractibility<span class="tooltip">Attention easily drawn to interesting or novel stimuli in the environment</span></a> by more interesting stimuli, all-or-nothing focus patterns, and difficulty shifting attention when absorbed.</p>

<p><strong>Executive Function Challenges:</strong> Difficulty with the brain's management systems for planning, organizing, and completing tasks in expected timeframes. This includes <a class="jargon">task initiation paralysis<span class="tooltip">Difficulty starting tasks even when you know they're important and want to complete them</span></a>, <a class="jargon">working memory<span class="tooltip">The brain's ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily while completing tasks</span></a> limitations, <a class="jargon">time blindness<span class="tooltip">Difficulty accurately estimating how much time tasks will take or how much time has passed</span></a> and planning difficulties, organization and priority management challenges, difficulty breaking large tasks into manageable steps, and inconsistent <a class="jargon">follow-through<span class="tooltip">Completing tasks and projects from start to finish, particularly with long-term or multi-step activities</span></a> despite good intentions.</p>

<p><strong>Impulse Control and Hyperactivity:</strong> Immediate response to thoughts, feelings, and environmental stimuli, often before considering consequences. This can involve speaking or acting before fully thinking through, difficulty waiting in situations that require patience, <a class="jargon">physical restlessness<span class="tooltip">Need for movement and difficulty sitting still for extended periods</span></a> and fidgeting, internal mental restlessness and racing thoughts, interrupting conversations unintentionally, and emotional reactions that happen quickly and intensely.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional and Social Patterns:</strong> Intense emotions and social differences that create unique relational challenges and strengths, including <a class="jargon">rejection sensitive dysphoria<span class="tooltip">Extreme emotional pain triggered by perceived or real rejection, criticism, or failure</span></a>, emotional highs and lows that feel intense, difficulty with criticism or feedback, social interaction patterns others might find overwhelming, deep empathy and enthusiasm when engaged, and justice-sensitivity and advocacy for fairness.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Important:</strong> <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> frequently appears alongside other <a class="jargon">neurodivergent<span class="tooltip">Brain differences that create distinct patterns of thinking, processing, and behavior</span></a> conditions and mental health differences. Many people have both <a class="jargon">ADHD<span class="tooltip">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - brain differences affecting attention, impulse control, and executive function</span></a> and autism, sharing <a class="jargon">sensory processing<span class="tooltip">How the nervous system receives and responds to sensory information from the environment and body</span></a> differences and social challenges. Anxiety and depression often develop from years of struggling in <a class="jargon">neurotypical<span class="tooltip">People whose brains develop and function in ways that align with societal expectations and norms</span></a> environments without understanding or support.
